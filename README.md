# Diffusion-generated-motion
Diffusion generated motion was initally proposed in April 1992. The original CAM report is at https://secure.math.ucla.edu/cam/camreport/cam92-18.pdf


The code files are organised as follows:
1. **dgm.m** contains code to implement diffusion generated motion. 
2. **lap.m** conatins code for the discrete Laplacian with 3 types of stencils. 
3. **grad.m** contains code for variable diffusivity. 
4. **ls.m** contains code to implement level set method for a circle and a square.
5. **imgs** contains initial images. 
6. **gifs** contains gifs of some particular configurations.
7. **APMA_935_Project_KP.pdf** contains my report.

Thanks for visiting :)
